# MomentMatching.jl

This package provides functionality for generating scenario sets whose marginals have specified first four moments and given correlation structure. It is a Julia interface for the C API developed by [Michal Kaut](http://work.michalkaut.net/) which implements the moment matching algorithm described in the following paper:

- HÃ¸yland, K., Kaut, M. & Wallace, S.W. Computational Optimization and Applications (2003) 24: 169. https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1021853807313

# Installation

In the package mode in the Julia REPL, run the following command:

```julia
pkg> add https://github.com/fairbrot/MomentMatching.jl.git
```

The package build process compiles C source code and assumes the user has `make` and `gcc` installed on their computer.
This package software was developed on Linux, and so it is possible that this build process may need to be adapted for other operating systems.

# Basic Usage

The package provides two main functions:

- `moments`: utility for calculating the first four moments of each marginal of a scenario set
- `scengen_HKW`: function for generating scenario set with required moments and correlations

Moments are specified by a d x 4 matrix where d is the number of dimensions of the required scenario set.
The specified moments are *mean, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis*.
Correlations are specified by a d x d matrix.

The `scengen_HKW` functions outputs scenarios as an d x S matrix where d is the dimension of the scenarios, and S is the number scenarios. Each column corresponds to a single scenario.

## Example

```julia
tg_moms = [[0.0 1.0 1.0 0.0]; [1.0 2.0 -1.0 1.0]] # Target moments
tg_cors = [[1 0.5]; [0.5 1]] # Target correlations
num_scen = 100
scenarios = scengen_HKW(tg_moms, tg_cors, num_scen)
```
## Checking output

Sometimes the algorithm will not be able to construct a scenario set with the required properties, for example if the moments are inconsistent, or if there are too few scenarios available to construct the set.
It is therefore important the user checks the output.
The `moments` function is useful for this purpose:

```julia
using LinearAlgebra # for norm function
using Statistics # for cor function

moms = moments(scenarios)
cors = cor(scenarios, dims=2)

@assert norm(moms - tg_moms, Inf) < 1e-3
@assert norm(cors - tg_cors, Inf) < 1e-3
```

## Other options
By default, the `scengen_HKW` assumes that the constructed scenarios are equiprobable. However, a method of the function exists which allows users to specify a vector of probabilities for the scenarios which are output by the algorithm.
The function also has several keyword arguments which allow the user to control algorithm behaviour such as required accuracy of the scenario set's moments and correlations.
A method of `moments` also exists which allows the user to specify probabilities of scenarios.
Refer to the package documentation for more detailed information on the options available for these functions.

```julia
help?> scengen_HKW
```

# Future development
The C API contains many more options than currently have been made available. For example, it is possible to initialise the algorithm with user specified scenarios (by default initial values are generated from a Normal(0,1) distribution).
The C API also allows one to control the way moments are input (e.g. using non-centralised moments), and allows one to extract algorithm run information such as the number of iterations and trials it took for the algorithm to terminate.
If you find this package useful, and would like other features to be made available please feel free to open an issue, or even make a pull request.
